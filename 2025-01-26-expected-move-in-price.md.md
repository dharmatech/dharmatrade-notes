> Movement in price is usually denominated in dollars, points, or percent. Movement in price is rarely, if ever, denominated in what really mattersâ€”the price change in relation to historical volatility, i.e., the price change relative to how much it usually moves.

> If two stocks, A and B, both move 5.00% tomorrow, that's not very useful information on its own. If we know, however, that Stock A has been moving 1.00% per day, on average; and Stock B has been moving 10.00% per day, on average; then we're able to place those percentage moves in context:
>
> * Stock A moved 5.00x its average expected move.
> * Stock B moved 0.50x its average expected move.
>
> Another way to express the multiple of the expected move is in "mean absolute deviation" (MAD). A 1.00x move is a 1 MAD move. A 5.00x move is a 5 MAD move. A 5 MAD move is big.
